            <h2 class="clean-h2">Let's Break it Down a Bit</h2>
            <p>Some of the numbers used to display the marketcap of bitcoin and other large numbers, like how much money
                it would take to reach the moon, is sometimes a bit hard to imagine. So below you'll find a few other
                numbers that are
                much larger and will help really scale things down (or up) a bit in order to increase our understanding.

        <div class="copy accent-1">
            <h2 class="clean-h2">The National Debt</h2>
            <h4>The national debt is currently at <span id="national-debt-span" class="money-span"></span></h4>

            <p>Let's try and put that into perspective really quickly. Would the current national debt reach the moon?
                Yes, about <span id="national-debt-trips-to-moon"></span> times to be exact. In fact, the national debt
                in pennies could almost reach Pluto. We are currently about <span id="pennies-to-pluto-span"></span> of
                the way there. <i>(calculated using the current national debt and avg. distance to Pluto,
                    5,906,380,000 km)</i>
            </p>

            <p>The way my brain works, I want to know even bigger numbers, so what if we were to take the current
                national debt, and turn it into dollar bills, and measure how far it would stretch if you taped each
                dollar bill to each-other using the short end? Well if you do it that way, we've already reached Pluto.
                <span id="bill-length-to-pluto"></span> times to be exact.
            </p>

            <p>Okay last one, hang with me here. What if you were to wrap planet Earth in that same amount of money?
                Let's see. So in order to calculate that we need Earth's circumference, (the equator) which is about
                <strong>40,075 km</strong>.
                Now if we divide the length of our current national debt in $1 bills, that's <span
                    id="national-debt-length"></span> by Earth's circumference, we get how many times we could wrap the
                Earth in dollar bills. That number is about <span id="times-earth-wrapped"></span>.
            </p>
            <p>So how tall would
                that stack of money be? Let's multiply that by the height of a dollar (0.11 mm). That means the stack
                would be about <span id="wrap-height"></span> tall. Which is roughly about <span
                    id="wrapped-height-in-feet"></span>.
                Basically a building that is <span id="stories-tall"></span>
                tall. That is wild to imagine.</p>
