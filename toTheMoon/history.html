                <p><strong>The Birth of the Idea</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>October 31, 2008:</strong> Someone named Satoshi Nakamoto publishes a whitepaper titled
                        "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What did that introduce?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decentralized money</li>
                    <li>The Blockchain</li>
                    <li>A fixed supply (21 million coins)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>In 2009 Bitcoin Is Live</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>January 3rd, 2009:</strong> The first block is ever mined, this block was called the
                        <strong>"Genesis Block".</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>January 12th, 2009:</strong> The first Bitcoin transaction in history is made. This
                        transaction was between (Satoshi to Hal Finney).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>At this point in time, Bitcoin still has no value, it's just some programmers who are entranced by
                    the
                    idea running wild with their code.</p>

                        in exchange for about 10,000 Bitcoins. A transaction that today would cost someone around <span
